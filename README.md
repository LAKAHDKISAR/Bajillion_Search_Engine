## About_This_Project
This Bajillion Search Engine was developed as my Final Project for Stanford Universityâ€™s Code in Place course. The goal was to create a meaningful, functional application using the skills I learned during the course.
Currently, the project runs as a Streamlit-based GUI application, allowing users to search news articles from multiple sources (New York Times and The Guardian) in a simple and interactive interface.
In the future, I plan to extend and enhance this project by developing a full web application version with richer features, improved UI/UX, and additional data sources.

## Dataset_Used
This project fetches live data from:
- The New York Times Article Search API
- The Guardian Content API
- No local dataset is stored; all data is fetched dynamically based on user input.
